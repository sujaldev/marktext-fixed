# Marktext Fixed

I used marktext, did not like it, making my own markdown editor.

### About the license

I am a bit confused on what license to use as the libraries used here all have
different licenses. Currently, I have used the MIT License but on a quick google
search the apache 2.0 license seems more appropriate. I'll look into this later
once I have a basic demo ready.
